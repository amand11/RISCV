# RISCV
RISC-V simulator


Phase 1 :-
Assembly code to machine code conversion

Phase 2 :-
Implemented data path and control paths to run the Instructions.
Implemented all stages i.e. Fetch, Execute, Decode, Memory, Writeback
Implemented inter state buffers, memory unit and register files for the same

Phase 3 :-
Implemented pipeline structure with and without data forwarding
Implemented -bit predictor for branch instructions
Functionality to switch between modes :-
  Non- pipelined
  Pipelined with stalls
  Pipelined with Data forwarding
  Pipelined with 1-bit predictor
