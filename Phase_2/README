Languages:- C++

TEAM MEMBERS:- 
        *Prateek Saini (2018CSB1114)
	*Naveen Yadav  (2018CSB1106)
	*Aman Dhawan   (2018CSB1070)
	*Vikram Singh  (2018CSB1194)
	*Vishal Yadav  (2018CSB1128)

Phase 2:-
Implemented data path and control paths to run the Instructions.
Implemented all stages i.e. Fetch, Execute, Decode, Memory, RegWrite
Implemented memory unit and register files for the same

HOW TO RUN:-
------------
	Build the Program	
		$cd src
		$make
	
	Write Your input in .mc filed named "example.txt"	

        On the terminal :-
        g++ main.cpp
        ./a.out
	You will get your desired output in terminal.


Work by Indviduals:-
------------

Prateek Saini -> I and R format
Naveen Yadav -> I, R , SB and UJ format
	     -> overall structure of code(main.cpp)
	     -> .text part execution 
Aman Dhawan -> U and S format , 
            -> .data part exection and Documentation .
Vishal Yadav -> UJ and SB format

Algorithm and Methodology -> See Design Document

Assumption:-
1)ld and sd is not supported and will throw error with message that they are not available.
2)Input document("example.txt") should not have extra and empty line at the end.
3)Structure of input files should be
	I).text with program counter and machine code separated by single space. Format is "Program-counter machine-code", both machine code and program counter are in hex
	II)The to end .text, well have Program counter and string("END PROGRAM"), serrated by single space.
	III)Then .Data component should be there, and last data type should be word(because of some limitation). format is “Location data”, location and data is in hex
