Design and implement the pipelining in the  function simulator in C++ for 32bit RISCV ISA instructions. Function simulator takes instruction encoding in .mc file as input. .mc file has the following format:

All the instructions in the given in the input .mc file is executed as per the functional behavior of the instructions. Each instruction in pipelined manner(depend on the knob is on or of) must go through the in the pipelined phases with support of data forwarding and one bit predictor:

 - Fetch
 - Decode
 - Execute
 - Memory
 - Write back(Reg Write)


Along with execution of instruction stages, simulator also provide messages what it is doing in each stage, Implements an additional instruction which exits the simulator, writes the data memory in .mc file before exiting.  
Control hazards and Data are looked and corrected.


You must test the software using assembly programs:
 - Fibonacci Program
 - Sum of the array of N elements. Initialize an array in first loop with each element equal to its index. In second loop find the sum of this array, and store the result at Arr[N].   
 - Factorial Program
 - Bubble Sort Program
 - Palindrome
